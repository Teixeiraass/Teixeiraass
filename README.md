  <b>💻 Full Stack Developer | IoT & AI Enthusiast | The guy who never says no to a challenge 👊</b>
</p>

I'm a Computer Science graduate passionate about building creative tech solutions that make life easier.  
Currently diving deep into the world of **Internet of Things (IoT)**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and modern web applications.
  
👨‍💻 I enjoy working across the stack — front-end, back-end, APIs — and playing with automation, smart systems, and data-driven dashboards.
  
🚀 Always open to learning something new, experimenting with new technologies, and turning ideas into functional (and good-looking) code. 😁

## 📚 Currently Learning:
- 🧠 Improving TypeScript & Angular for complex front-end projects
- 🌱 Exploring IoT automation with ESP32 and sensor integration
- 🤖 Integrating AI models for smart irrigation optimization
- ☁️ Building RESTful APIs using both Node.js and Golang for efficient and scalable backend services

## 🚧 Personal Project / Thesis (TCC):
🎓 I'm developing an intelligent monitoring and automation system for gardens and small crops.  
💧 The system enables automatic irrigation based on soil moisture, measures sunlight and temperature, and alerts the user about plant stress conditions.
  
📈 The solution also includes a real-time dashboard, allowing users to track data, set timers, control irrigation remotely, and receive insights for keeping plants healthy and     thriving.
